# Code Guidelines

- C++17/C++20 stuff
- only idiomatic C++
- try to avoid C stuff
- no <cstdlib>
- no <cstdio>
- try to mildly avoid C pointers
- use templates for flexibility of the code
- using camelCase or C case inside locals
- for class names go with ClassName
- with namespaces go with penis::test::something
