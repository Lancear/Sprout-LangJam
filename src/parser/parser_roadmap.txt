quirks the codegen team should be aware of:
 -> currently 'let name1.param = 3` is valid syntax; although next revisions
    of the parser will fix this problem.
 -> this problem appears in other contexts too.

TODO:
 -> [X] preinc/postinc predec/postdec
 -> event handler declaration, emit statementy
 -> [X] class declarations
 -> class members
 -> inline event handlers via @ (local, global)
 -> mutable parameters, references, mutable referenced parameters
 -> pattern matching
 -> [X] tenary operator
 -> templates
 -> [X] do..while
 -> reference syntax
 -> lambda syntax (single expression makes implicit braces and return)

Optional TODOs:
 -> add some checks to the parser (to take off some work from the codegen guys)
